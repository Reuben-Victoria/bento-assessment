### Code Style üßëüèΩ‚Äçüíª

The code was styled with SCSS.

Styles folder typically contains the apps styles files:

### Thoughts

- **Initial Approach** : Broke down tasks into manageable parts and focused on component reusability and consistent styling with SCSS.
- **Component Reusability** : Ensured components were reusable to maintain a scalable codebase.
- **Styling Consistency**: Focused on maintaining a uniform look and feel through consistent styling.

### Assumptions

- **Data Structure** : Assumed the API data structure would remain consistent as documented.
-  **Responsive Design** : Assumed the need for a fully responsive application, emphasizing media queries and flexible layouts.
- **Browser Compatibility** : Optimized for modern browsers, not focusing on older ones.

### Issues Faced

- **API Integration**: Encountered challenges with data handling from the API, resolved through robust error handling.
- **Styling Synchronization** : Fixed asynchronous pulsating animations in the skeleton loader by standardizing animation properties.
- **TypeScript Errors**: Addressed type issues especially in the `BookCard` component by refining type definitions and ensuring correct data types.
- **Responsive Design**: Achieved consistent layout through iterative testing and adjustments using media queries and flexbox.
