The code was styled with SCSS.

Styles folder typically contains the apps styles files:

### Thoughts

- _ Initial Approach _** : Broke down tasks into manageable parts and focused on component reusability and consistent styling with SCSS.
- _ Component Reusability _ : Ensured components were reusable to maintain a scalable codebase.
- _ Styling Consistency _: Focused on maintaining a uniform look and feel through consistent styling.

### Assumptions

- _ Data Structure _ : Assumed the API data structure would remain consistent as documented.
-  _ Responsive Design _ : Assumed the need for a fully responsive application, emphasizing media queries and flexible layouts.
- _ Browser Compatibility _ : Optimized for modern browsers, not focusing on older ones.

### Issues Faced

- _ API Integration _: Encountered challenges with data handling from the API, resolved through robust error handling.
- _ Styling Synchronization _ : Fixed asynchronous pulsating animations in the skeleton loader by standardizing animation properties.
- _ TypeScript Errors _: Addressed type issues especially in the `BookCard` component by refining type definitions and ensuring correct data types.
- _ Responsive Design _: Achieved consistent layout through iterative testing and adjustments using media queries and flexbox.
